# This is the data from an experiment. The IV is the experimenal condition with 4 levels. Its moderator is General Conspiracy Belief. The DV will be changed in each graph.
*My original interpretation from looking at plot 1 was that the moderator is message type, while the IV was supposed to be the level of conspiracy. I might be misunderstanding something though!*

# Create Plot 1: DV is Intention to vaccinate their fictional children.
# P.S. I cannot rename one of my variables: from "Ã¯..GenConBlf" into "GenConBlf". If you could, please let me know.
*It looks like the variable was able to be renamed into GenConBlf! I will go ahead and change the variable name in the ggplot code below*
```{r}
data %>% ggplot(aes(GenConBlf, VacIntMMR))+
  geom_point(aes(color = Condition), alpha = .3)+
  geom_smooth(aes(color = Condition), method = "lm", se = FALSE)+

#Strengths: The plot is aesthetically pleasing and  easy to interpret! I like that you included the points along with geom smooth to show some of the variability. The color choice is very pretty! Are these colors also color-blind friendly
#Possible suggestions: To make the graph more easily comprehensible, is it possible to provide information on what the 1-5 levels of the IV and DV mean? For example does a 5 on the MMR vaccination intention scale indicate that someone is very likely to vaccinate? Does 1 indicate "not very likely"? If so, perhaps you could include those labels instead of 1-5 or along with 1-5. Also since the level of intent is your DV, I think it would make more sense to switch your x and y variable. (I made this edit above. I think you just mixed up the labeling of the x and y axes, but that you completed the correct fo;)

#Strengths: nice use of colors and bar charts here. It's quick and easy to see the differences across the ages and political parties without having to spend too much time measuring or starting at the plot. 
#Possible suggestions: I think she plot would be a nice example where defining what 1-4 means for the y variable. That's interesting that there are no Democratic participants 18-20 group, and no independents in the oldest age group. I think you can remove the x label here so that there's less things distracting from the data viz.
